Ironhack Data Analytics Final Project 

### :running: **One-liner**
The aim of the project is to analyze different online sales channels of a textile company  (Amazon, Showroom Priv√© and Privalia) and build an exploratory data analysis report to capture a large amount of data in a clear and concise manner and gain initial insight on our dataset.

The project has been focused above all on analyzing the correlation between stock and sales.Seeing the great correlation, the next step was to detect the turnover that was lost in 2020 due to lack of stock of certain references.

Finally, the Prophet library was used to make a forecast of the sales of 8 references to have a correct stock level.
